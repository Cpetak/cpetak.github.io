    "text": "Personal life\nI live in Denver, CO, with my Golden Retriever, Oliver. Born in Budapest, Hungary, I’ve spent my formative years in England, but have called the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria and the United States home at various points in my life. Since 2020, I’ve been living in the United States, where I am a permanent resident.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly Cold War history and classical Greek drama), cooking (with not a lot of success) and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I’m credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers (OEIS A344856), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job.\nI live with neuromyelitis optica since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better.\nIn what little is left of my free time, I’m an adaptive multisport athlete, competing in wheelchair rugby, adaptive rowing (category PR1) and the SkiErg (category SIT2). In the latter, I currently hold the world records for 100m, 500m, 1,000m, 2,000m, 6,000m, 10,000m, 21,097m and 42,195m distances and the 60 minutes time. I occasionally rant and whine about my forays in the world of adaptive exercise and my attempts at doing so in a mostly science-based manner."
