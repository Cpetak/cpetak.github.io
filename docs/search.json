    "text": "I am a finishing PhD student at the University of Vermont, USA. I am interested in artificial life, the evolution of evolvability and development.\n\n\nAs part of my PhD thesis research, I have developed the following computational models:\n\nSimple gene regulatory networks in a variable environment first evolved such that a few mutations could result in switching between phenotypes optimal in alternative environments - diversifying bet-hedgers reduced risk by making sure at least some of their offspring would be fit regardless of an unexpected environmental change. However, we found this strategy was quickly outcompeted by a more conservative strategy that only produced offspring with a phenotype intermediate between the two alternative optimal phenotypes. We think that this was due to the properties of the genotype landscape underlying these strategies. Published peer-reviewed paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Effect of mutations on an evolved conservative and diversifying bet-hedger GRN in the 3D space of strategies. Lines represent the different random walks. The conservative BH is more robust than the diversifying BH.\n\n\n\nUsing cellular automata (CA) rules to generate a set of target developmental trajectories, we found that the effect of environmental variability depended on the specific CA rule that was used. Frequently changing the environment had a negative effect on the maximum fitness the population could reach in some cases, while in other cases, varying the environments resulted in the populations reaching higher fitness peaks. Again, these results show that evolutionary dynamics in varying environments depend on the genotype landscape. This work is in review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Left: Difference in maximum fitnesses after evolution in a variable environment compared to evolution in the first environment alone (x-axis) and in the second environment alone (y-axis), averaged across replicates. The two columns on the right are showing the two specific target patterns for each rule that was used in the evolutionary algorithm. Right: Maximum fitness in the population over time for different CA rules to highlight behaviors for all four quadrants in the left figure.\n\n\n\nA two-loci population genetic model showed that an allele that increases phenotypic variability, that is usually considered a good strategy in a variable environment, can also be selected for in static environments under some circumstances, even if the average effect of the variation is negative, and the new phenotypic traits are not heritable. We found that increasing the selection pressure helped this allele spread, and that the population size had an interesting non-linear effect on the probability of fixation, tightly related to heritability. Manuscript in preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Example run with no inheritance. Increase variability (blue) and wild-type (orange) lineages. Even though less blue carriers have offspring, the ones that do have a lot of offspring under high selection pressure conditions, offsetting the average negative effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy whole-genome sequencing a 140 purple sea urchins collected from seven populations experiencing different levels of environmental variability, I generated a very useful resource to investigate the structure and genetic diversity of these marine populations, as well as to find genetic variation putatively involved local adaptation to environmental variability. Interestingly, we found that such genetic variation was mostly regulatory and found in regions predicted to have phenotypic effects with low levels of pleiotropy. Published peer-reviewed paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Protein-protein interaction network showing that genetic variation involved in local adaptation (larger nodes) are less central and therefore are less likely to have highly pleiotropic effects."

    "text": "Personal life\nI live in Denver, CO, with my Golden Retriever, Oliver. Born in Budapest, Hungary, I’ve spent my formative years in England, but have called the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Austria and the United States home at various points in my life. Since 2020, I’ve been living in the United States, where I am a permanent resident.\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading (mostly Cold War history and classical Greek drama), cooking (with not a lot of success) and Renaissance polyphony (esp. Thomas Tallis and Orlando di Lasso). I’m credited for a somewhat pretty sequence of integers called Jellyfish Heart numbers (OEIS A344856), which I discovered in 2020 while doing something that has nothing at all to do with my day job.\nI live with neuromyelitis optica since 2015, which has left me with a lifelong desire to understand complex, multicausal health conditions like NMOSD better.\nIn what little is left of my free time, I’m an adaptive multisport athlete, competing in wheelchair rugby, adaptive rowing (category PR1) and the SkiErg (category SIT2). In the latter, I currently hold the world records for 100m, 500m, 1,000m, 2,000m, 6,000m, 10,000m, 21,097m and 42,195m distances and the 60 minutes time. I occasionally rant and whine about my forays in the world of adaptive exercise and my attempts at doing so in a mostly science-based manner."
